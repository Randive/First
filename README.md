# 1. Identity API v3 (CURRENT)
**Gets an authentication token that permits access to the OpenStack services REST API.**

**Like most OpenStack projects, OpenStack Identity protects its APIs by defining policy rules based on a role-based access control (RBAC) approach. These rules are stored in a JSON policy file. The Identity service configuration file, keystone.conf, sets the name and location of this policy file. For information about Identity API protection, see Identity API protection with role-based access control (RBAC) in the OpenStack Cloud Administrator Guide.**
